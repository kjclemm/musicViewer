# musicViewer

Unlike iOS, Android currently lacks a PDF app that supports music-related PDFs. This app aims to fill that gap by providing a platform to store PDFs in a database and retrieve music-related ones. The app will be equipped with a metronome, tuner, and other features for musicians. Additionally, when viewing the PDFs, the app will support page flipping. This means users can control the visibility of the next and previous pages when transitioning, allowing them to time their page turns appropriately.

Implemented Features:
Recycler View showing PDFs, Uploading PDFs and retrival of PDFs, Firebase Database integrated

TODO:
Add Images of App to Readme
Implement: Page turns, mentonome, and tunner, deleation of different PDFs, Sorting, Searching, and filteirng, and Authentication

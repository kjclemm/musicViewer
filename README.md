# musicViewer

Unlike for iOS there is no PDF app that supports music related PDFs on Android. This app aims
to be an app that can hold PDFs uploaded to a database and then retreive those PDFs that are music related.
The app will be integrated with a mentonome, tunner and other features for muscians.
Additionaly the pdfs when viewed will support page flipping that is the user can determin when moving to the next page
how much of the next page and previous page is vissible in order to time page turns out properly.
